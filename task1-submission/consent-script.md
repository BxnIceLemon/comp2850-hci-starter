## Verbal Consent Script

(To be read to the participant before the session begins)

"Hi, thank you for helping me today.

I am testing the robustness and accessibility of a Task Manager application. I want to make it clear that **I am testing
the code, not you**. If you find something difficult to do, that helps me find a bug in the design.

**Procedure**:
I will ask you to perform 4 short tasks (finding, adding, editing, and deleting items).

**Data Collection**:
I will be recording anonymous usage data, such as:

- Which buttons you click
- How long tasks take
- Whether errors occur

**Privacy & Ethics**:

- No personal information (like your name) will be stored.
- Your data will be anonymized using a session ID (e.g., P1, P2).
- Participation is voluntary. You can stop the session at any time without giving a reason.

**Do you agree to participate under these conditions?**"
