# Job Stories — Week 6 Needs-Finding

## Story S1: Keyboard access to all controls

**Situation**: When I am managing my tasks on a laptop using keyboard-only workflows, and my mouse or touchpad is unavailable or unreliable
**Motivation**: I want to navigate through tasks, activate delete and other controls, and always see where the focus is using the keyboard alone
**Outcome**: So I can manage my task list efficiently without getting stuck, lost, or forced to switch to a pointing device
**Underlying need**: Because unreliable keyboard access and invisible focus leave me temporarily excluded from core actions and break my concentration

**Evidence**: Participant A (notes_A L7, L40)
**Inclusion risk**: Keyboard-only users, Motor impairments, Screen reader users
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 2.1.1 Keyboard (A)

## Story S2: Confirmation feedback for task actions

**Situation**: When I submit a form to add, edit, or delete a task in the task manager
**Motivation**: I want immediate, explicit confirmation or a short summary that tells me what changed and that the action succeeded
**Outcome**: So I can trust that my tasks are captured correctly and avoid repeatedly re-checking the list to see if anything actually updated
**Underlying need**: Because uncertainty about whether changes were saved increases anxiety and leads to inefficient coping behaviours like constant re-scanning

**Evidence**: Participant C (notes_C L7), Participant A (notes_A L29)
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, Anxiety, Low digital literacy, Screen reader users
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)

## Story S3: Sufficient contrast and legible text in bright conditions

**Situation**: When I am checking my tasks on a mobile phone in bright sunlight or when my eyes are tired
**Motivation**: I want text and controls with sufficient contrast and size, and ideally an option to have tasks spoken aloud
**Outcome**: So I can still read or understand my tasks without straining my eyes or giving up on using the app in these conditions
**Underlying need**: Because low contrast and small text in glare conditions create a situational visual disability and make the task manager effectively unusable

**Evidence**: Participant B (notes_B L41)
**Inclusion risk**: Low-vision, Eye strain, Situational impairment (glare), Older users
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum (AA)

## Story S4: Clear error messages and validation for time-sensitive tasks

**Situation**: When I enter or edit time-sensitive tasks such as appointments or deadlines in the task manager
**Motivation**: I want the app to validate my input and clearly warn me if a date is in the past or obviously incorrect
**Outcome**: So I can correct mistakes immediately instead of silently misconfiguring important tasks and discovering the error only after it is too late
**Underlying need**: Because missing critical events like medical appointments due to unnoticed input errors can have serious real-world consequences

**Evidence**: Participant C (notes_C L19), Participant B (notes_B L30)
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, Memory issues, Low digital literacy, Users managing health-related or high-stakes tasks
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 3.3.1 Error Identification (A)

## Story S5: Maintaining focus and context in long task lists

**Situation**: When I filter or scan a long task list to focus on a specific module or set of priorities
**Motivation**: I want my filters, sort order, and focus context to persist across page reloads and navigation
**Outcome**: So I can stay oriented on the subset of tasks that matter right now instead of repeatedly rebuilding my view and losing track of what I was doing
**Underlying need**: Because losing context forces extra cognitive effort, increases the risk of missing important items, and makes long lists feel overwhelming

**Evidence**: Participant A (notes_A L18, L29), Participant B (notes_B L18)
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, ADHD or attention difficulties, Busy students juggling multiple modules, Users with memory challenges
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 2.4.3 Focus Order (A)

## Story S6: Reassuring daily summaries and travel mode

**Situation**: When I quickly check my tasks during a busy day or while commuting with limited attention and unreliable signal
**Motivation**: I want a simplified view or mode that shows a short, reassuring summary of today’s tasks, what is already done, and what comes next, with larger controls suitable for one-handed use
**Outcome**: So I can feel in control instead of imagining “hundreds of unknown tasks” hiding in the list, and I can safely interact with the app on the move
**Underlying need**: Because anxious users and commuters need calm, easy-to-digest overviews and forgiving controls rather than dense, cluttered lists that amplify stress

**Evidence**: Participant C (notes_C L7, L42), Participant B (notes_B L7, L53), Participant A (notes_A L51)
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, Anxiety, One-handed mobile use, Situational impairment (commuting, motion), Low digital literacy
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 1.4.4 Resize Text (AA), 1.4.10 Reflow (AA)
